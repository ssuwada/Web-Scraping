# Sunscreens Web scraping project 

This project, initially created for web scraping classes, involves two contributors. I handled the first part, which involves scraping data, while ** Sandra Stanowska ** took care of the data cleaning, preparation, and analysis. The project includes:


- cleaned CSV file containing information about all sunscreens available on ulta.com
- an uncleaned CSV file
- code for scraping data
- the main core of the code
- an SPF file primarily used for data analysis
- an HTML file serving as a basic report on our project
- an R Markdown (.rmd) file, which serves as a template for generating an HTML report
